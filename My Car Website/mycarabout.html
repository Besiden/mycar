        <p>The Subaru Legacy (Japanese: スバル・レガシィ Subaru Regashi) is a mid-size car built by Japanese automobile manufacturer Subaru since 1989. The maker's flagship car, it is unique in its class for offering all wheel drive as a standard feature, and Subaru's traditional boxer engine. The Legacy bears the name Liberty in Australia out of deference to Legacy Australia, an organisation dedicated to caring for the families of military service veterans.

                In 1996, a variant of the Legacy with heightened suspension called the Legacy Outback was introduced to compete in the burgeoning sport-utility vehicle class and proved to be a sales success for Subaru. The Outback line was split into its own model in 2000, known as the Subaru Outback.
                
                As of 2008, 3.6 million Legacys have been built since its 1989 introduction</p>
